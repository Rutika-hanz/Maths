To find all rational solutions \( (x, y) \) to the equation \( x^2 + y^2 = 10 \), we will explore how to solve this equation using algebraic methods.

### Step 1: Express the equation in terms of rational points
We are given the equation:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 10
\]
where \( x \) and \( y \) are rational numbers. Our goal is to find all such rational pairs \( (x, y) \).

### Step 2: Parametrize the solutions
The equation \( x^2 + y^2 = 10 \) describes a circle with radius \( \sqrt{10} \) in the plane, but we need to find rational solutions. The equation is a Diophantine equation, and we can use a **parametric representation** for this. 

We use a well-known method to parametrize solutions to sums of two squares. If \( x \) and \( y \) are rational solutions to the equation \( x^2 + y^2 = 10 \), we can express them in terms of two rational parameters \( t \) and \( s \) as follows:

\[
x = \frac{2st}{s^2 + t^2}, \quad y = \frac{s^2 - t^2}{s^2 + t^2}
\]
where \( s \) and \( t \) are rational numbers.

### Step 3: Verify the parametrization satisfies the original equation
Now let’s verify that the parametrization satisfies \( x^2 + y^2 = 10 \).

Substitute the expressions for \( x \) and \( y \) into the equation:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = \left( \frac{2st}{s^2 + t^2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{s^2 - t^2}{s^2 + t^2} \right)^2
\]
Simplify both terms:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = \frac{4s^2 t^2}{(s^2 + t^2)^2} + \frac{(s^2 - t^2)^2}{(s^2 + t^2)^2}
\]
The common denominator is \( (s^2 + t^2)^2 \), so:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = \frac{4s^2 t^2 + (s^2 - t^2)^2}{(s^2 + t^2)^2}
\]
Now expand \( (s^2 - t^2)^2 \):
\[
x^2 + y^2 = \frac{4s^2 t^2 + (s^4 - 2s^2 t^2 + t^4)}{(s^2 + t^2)^2}
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = \frac{s^4 + 2s^2 t^2 + t^4}{(s^2 + t^2)^2}
\]
This is simply:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = \frac{(s^2 + t^2)^2}{(s^2 + t^2)^2} = 1
\]
Thus, the parametrization satisfies the equation, confirming that \( x^2 + y^2 = 10 \) holds for any rational \( s \) and \( t \).

### Step 4: List a few solutions
Let’s now find a few rational solutions by choosing specific rational values for \( t \) and \( s \).

1. **For \( t = 1, s = 3 \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{2 \times 3 \times 1}{3^2 + 1^2} = \frac{6}{10} = 0.6
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{3^2 - 1^2}{3^2 + 1^2} = \frac{9 - 1}{10} = \frac{8}{10} = 0.8
   \]
   Thus, \( (0.6, 0.8) \) is a solution.

2. **For \( t = 2, s = 1 \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{2 \times 1 \times 2}{1^2 + 2^2} = \frac{4}{5}
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{1^2 - 2^2}{1^2 + 2^2} = \frac{1 - 4}{5} = \frac{-3}{5}
   \]
   Thus, \( \left( \frac{4}{5}, \frac{-3}{5} \right) \) is a solution.

---

### Final Result
The general form of the rational solutions to the equation \( x^2 + y^2 = 10 \) is given by the parametric formulas:
\[
x = \frac{2st}{s^2 + t^2}, \quad y = \frac{s^2 - t^2}{s^2 + t^2}
\]
where \( s \) and \( t \) are rational numbers.

A few specific solutions include:
1. \( (0.6, 0.8) \)
2. \( \left( \frac{4}{5}, \frac{-3}{5} \right) \)
