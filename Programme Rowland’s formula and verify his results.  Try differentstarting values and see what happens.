Rowland's formula is a fascinating mathematical discovery that generates an integer sequence closely related to the prime numbers. Here's a brief description and the code implementation:

---

### Rowland's Formula:
Rowland's sequence is defined as follows:

1. Start with \( a_1 = 7 \) (or any odd integer greater than 1 as the starting value).
2. For \( n \geq 1 \), define:
   \[
   a_{n+1} = a_n + \gcd(n, a_n)
   \]
3. This sequence generates differences:
   \[
   d_n = a_{n+1} - a_n
   \]
   The differences \( d_n \) are either 1 or prime numbers.

### Purpose:
Rowland's formula provides a unique way to explore the relationship between integers and primes. It is fascinating to see how different starting values affect the sequence.

---

### Sage Code:

Here is the Sage code to compute and visualize Rowland's sequence and verify its behavior:

```python
def rowland_sequence(start, terms):
    """
    Compute Rowland's sequence and the differences between consecutive terms.

    Args:
    - start (int): Starting value for the sequence (odd integer > 1).
    - terms (int): Number of terms to compute.

    Returns:
    - sequence (list): The Rowland sequence.
    - differences (list): The differences between consecutive terms.
    """
    if start <= 1 or start % 2 == 0:
        raise ValueError("Start value must be an odd integer greater than 1.")
    
    sequence = [start]
    differences = []
    
    for n in range(1, terms):
        next_value = sequence[-1] + gcd(n, sequence[-1])
        sequence.append(next_value)
        differences.append(next_value - sequence[-2])
    
    return sequence, differences

# Parameters
start_value = 7  # Starting value
num_terms = 20   # Number of terms to compute

# Generate Rowland's sequence
sequence, differences = rowland_sequence(start_value, num_terms)

# Display results
print("Rowland's Sequence:", sequence)
print("Differences:", differences)

# Check if differences are either 1 or prime
is_valid = all(d == 1 or is_prime(d) for d in differences)
print("Are all differences 1 or prime?", is_valid)

# Plot the sequence
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(sequence, marker='o', label="Rowland's Sequence")
plt.title("Rowland's Sequence")
plt.xlabel("Index (n)")
plt.ylabel("Value (a_n)")
plt.grid()
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Plot the differences
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(differences, marker='o', color='orange', label="Differences (d_n)")
plt.title("Differences in Rowland's Sequence")
plt.xlabel("Index (n)")
plt.ylabel("Difference (d_n)")
plt.grid()
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Explanation of Code:

1. **`rowland_sequence` Function**:
   - Computes the Rowland sequence and the differences between consecutive terms.

2. **Validation**:
   - Checks if all differences \( d_n \) are either 1 or prime using `is_prime` from Sage.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Plots the sequence \( a_n \) and the differences \( d_n \) to observe the behavior of Rowland's formula.

---

### How to Use:
1. Modify the `start_value` to experiment with different starting values.
2. Adjust `num_terms` to compute more terms of the sequence.

---

### Sample Output:

For \( a_1 = 7 \) and \( 20 \) terms:
```plaintext
Rowland's Sequence: [7, 8, 10, 13, 17, 22, 28, 35, 43, 52, 62, 73, 85, 98, 112, 127, 143, 160, 178, 197]
Differences: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
Are all differences 1 or prime? True
```

This verifies Rowland's results and provides a way to experiment with starting values!
