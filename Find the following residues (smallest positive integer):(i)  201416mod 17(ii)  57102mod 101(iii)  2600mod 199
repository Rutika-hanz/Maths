Here are the steps to solve each of the modular arithmetic problems:

### (i) \( 201416 \mod 17 \)

1. **Divide 201416 by 17**:
   \[
   \frac{201416}{17} = 11847 \text{ remainder } 0
   \]
   This means that 201416 is divisible by 17 with no remainder.

2. **Conclusion**:
   Since the remainder is 0, we can conclude that:
   \[
   201416 \mod 17 = 0
   \]

### (ii) \( 57102 \mod 101 \)

1. **Divide 57102 by 101**:
   \[
   \frac{57102}{101} = 565 \text{ remainder } 37
   \]
   This means that 57102 divided by 101 gives a quotient of 565 and a remainder of 37.

2. **Conclusion**:
   The remainder is 37, so:
   \[
   57102 \mod 101 = 37
   \]

---

### (iii) \( 2600 \mod 199 \)

1. **Divide 2600 by 199**:
   \[
   \frac{2600}{199} = 13 \text{ remainder } 13
   \]
   This means that 2600 divided by 199 gives a quotient of 13 and a remainder of 13.

2. **Conclusion**:
   The remainder is 13, so:
   \[
   2600 \mod 199 = 13
   \]

---

### Summary of Results:
- \( 201416 \mod 17 = 0 \)
- \( 57102 \mod 101 = 37 \)
- \( 2600 \mod 199 = 13 \)

In general, to find the remainder when dividing by a modulus, you simply perform the division and take the remainder from the quotient. This remainder is the result of the modulus operation.
