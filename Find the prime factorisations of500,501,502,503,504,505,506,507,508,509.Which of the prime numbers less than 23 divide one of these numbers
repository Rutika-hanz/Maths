To solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:

### Steps to Find Prime Factorizations:

1. **Prime Factorizations**: We need to find the prime factorizations of the numbers from 500 to 509. We can do this by dividing each number by prime numbers, starting from the smallest primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, etc.), until we get a prime factorization.

2. **List of Prime Numbers Less Than 23**: Identify all prime numbers less than 23. These are:
   \[
   \{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19\}
   \]

3. **Check Divisibility**: For each number between 500 and 509, check which of the primes less than 23 divide the number. If a prime divides the number, include that prime in the factorization.

4. **Prime Factorization of Each Number**: Find the prime factorization for each number between 500 and 509.

### Prime Factorizations:

Let's go through the factorization of each number between 500 and 509 manually.

#### 1. **500**:
- Start with the smallest prime, 2:  
  \( 500 \div 2 = 250 \)  
  \( 250 \div 2 = 125 \)  
  \( 125 \div 5 = 25 \)  
  \( 25 \div 5 = 5 \)  
  \( 5 \div 5 = 1 \)

So, the prime factorization of 500 is:  
\[
500 = 2^2 \times 5^3
\]

#### 2. **501**:
- Start with 3:  
  \( 501 \div 3 = 167 \)  
  167 is a prime number.

So, the prime factorization of 501 is:  
\[
501 = 3 \times 167
\]

#### 3. **502**:
- Start with 2:  
  \( 502 \div 2 = 251 \)  
  251 is a prime number.

So, the prime factorization of 502 is:  
\[
502 = 2 \times 251
\]

#### 4. **503**:
- Start with 3:  
  \( 503 \div 3 \) does not give an integer, so try the next primes.  
  503 is a prime number.

So, the prime factorization of 503 is:  
\[
503 = 503 \quad (\text{prime})
\]

#### 5. **504**:
- Start with 2:  
  \( 504 \div 2 = 252 \)  
  \( 252 \div 2 = 126 \)  
  \( 126 \div 2 = 63 \)  
  \( 63 \div 3 = 21 \)  
  \( 21 \div 3 = 7 \)  
  \( 7 \div 7 = 1 \)

So, the prime factorization of 504 is:  
\[
504 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 7
\]

#### 6. **505**:
- Start with 5:  
  \( 505 \div 5 = 101 \)  
  101 is a prime number.

So, the prime factorization of 505 is:  
\[
505 = 5 \times 101
\]

#### 7. **506**:
- Start with 2:  
  \( 506 \div 2 = 253 \)  
  \( 253 \div 11 = 23 \)  
  23 is a prime number.

So, the prime factorization of 506 is:  
\[
506 = 2 \times 11 \times 23
\]

#### 8. **507**:
- Start with 3:  
  \( 507 \div 3 = 169 \)  
  \( 169 \div 13 = 13 \)

So, the prime factorization of 507 is:  
\[
507 = 3 \times 13^2
\]

#### 9. **508**:
- Start with 2:  
  \( 508 \div 2 = 254 \)  
  \( 254 \div 2 = 127 \)  
  127 is a prime number.

So, the prime factorization of 508 is:  
\[
508 = 2^2 \times 127
\]

#### 10. **509**:
- Start with 3:  
  \( 509 \div 3 \) does not give an integer, so try the next primes.  
  \( 509 \div 7 \) does not give an integer either.  
  Try 509 with 23:  
  \( 509 \div 23 = 22.13 \) does not give an integer.  
  Therefore, 509 is a prime number.

So, the prime factorization of 509 is:  
\[
509 = 509 \quad (\text{prime})
\]

### Prime Numbers Less Than 23 Dividing These Numbers:
The prime numbers less than 23 are:
\[
\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19\}
\]

Now, let's list which primes divide at least one number from 500 to 509:

- 500: Divisible by \( 2, 5 \)
- 501: Divisible by \( 3 \)
- 502: Divisible by \( 2 \)
- 503: No primes less than 23 divide it (it is prime).
- 504: Divisible by \( 2, 3, 7 \)
- 505: Divisible by \( 5 \)
- 506: Divisible by \( 2, 11, 23 \)
- 507: Divisible by \( 3, 13 \)
- 508: Divisible by \( 2 \)
- 509: No primes less than 23 divide it (it is prime).
