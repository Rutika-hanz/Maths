To find the private key \( d \) when given the public key \( (m, k) = (377, 139) \), we are working within an **RSA** cryptosystem. The public key consists of \( m \) (the modulus) and \( k \) (the public exponent), while the private key \( d \) satisfies the congruence:

\[
d \cdot k \equiv 1 \mod \varphi(m)
\]

where \( \varphi(m) \) is the Euler's Totient Function of \( m \).

### Step 1: Find \( \varphi(m) \)

The modulus \( m = 377 \) is the product of two prime numbers, so we need to factorize 377. First, find the prime factorization of 377.

- \( 377 = 13 \times 29 \), where both 13 and 29 are primes.

Now, compute \( \varphi(377) \). Using the formula for Euler's Totient Function for \( m = p \times q \), where \( p \) and \( q \) are distinct primes:

\[
\varphi(m) = \varphi(13 \times 29) = (13 - 1) \times (29 - 1) = 12 \times 28 = 336
\]

So, \( \varphi(377) = 336 \).

### Step 2: Solve for \( d \)

We need to find the integer \( d \) such that:

\[
d \cdot k \equiv 1 \mod \varphi(m)
\]

Substituting the values \( k = 139 \) and \( \varphi(m) = 336 \), we need to solve:

\[
d \cdot 139 \equiv 1 \mod 336
\]

This can be done using the **Extended Euclidean Algorithm** to find the modular inverse of 139 modulo 336.

#### Step 2.1: Apply the Extended Euclidean Algorithm

We apply the Euclidean algorithm to 139 and 336 to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) and work backward to express 1 as a linear combination of 139 and 336.

1. \( 336 = 2 \times 139 + 58 \)
2. \( 139 = 2 \times 58 + 23 \)
3. \( 58 = 2 \times 23 + 12 \)
4. \( 23 = 1 \times 12 + 11 \)
5. \( 12 = 1 \times 11 + 1 \)
6. \( 11 = 11 \times 1 + 0 \)

Now, work backward to express 1 as a combination of 139 and 336:

1. \( 1 = 12 - 1 \times 11 \)
2. \( 1 = 12 - 1 \times (23 - 1 \times 12) = 2 \times 12 - 1 \times 23 \)
3. \( 1 = 2 \times (58 - 2 \times 23) - 1 \times 23 = 2 \times 58 - 5 \times 23 \)
4. \( 1 = 2 \times 58 - 5 \times (139 - 2 \times 58) = 12 \times 58 - 5 \times 139 \)
5. \( 1 = 12 \times (336 - 2 \times 139) - 5 \times 139 = 12 \times 336 - 29 \times 139 \)

So, \( 1 = 12 \times 336 - 29 \times 139 \).

Thus, the inverse of 139 modulo 336 is \( -29 \), and since we want a positive value for \( d \), we add 336 to \( -29 \) to get:

\[
d \equiv 336 - 29 = 307 \mod 336
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion

Therefore, the private key \( d \) is \( \boxed{307} \).
