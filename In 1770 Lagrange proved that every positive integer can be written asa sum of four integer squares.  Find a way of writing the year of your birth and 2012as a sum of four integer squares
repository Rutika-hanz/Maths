To understand how the four numbers \( a, b, c, d \) were chosen using **Legendre's Four-Square Method**, letâ€™s work through the example \( n = 2012 \) step by step. 

---

### Legendre's Method Overview
1. **Find the largest square \( a^2 \) less than or equal to \( n \).**
   - Start with \( a = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor \) (the largest integer \( a \) such that \( a^2 \leq n \)).

2. **Subtract \( a^2 \) from \( n \) to get the remainder \( r_1 \).**
   - Set \( r_1 = n - a^2 \).

3. **Repeat the process for the remainder \( r_1 \), finding the largest square \( b^2 \) such that \( b^2 \leq r_1 \).**

4. **Continue until \( r_3 = c^2 + d^2 \).**
   - This ensures \( n = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 \).

---

### Example: \( n = 2012 \)
#### Step 1: Find \( a^2 \)
- Compute \( a = \lfloor \sqrt{2012} \rfloor = 44 \).
- \( a^2 = 44^2 = 1936 \).
- Compute the remainder:
  \[
  r_1 = 2012 - 1936 = 76
  \]

#### Step 2: Find \( b^2 \)
- Compute \( b = \lfloor \sqrt{76} \rfloor = 6 \).
- \( b^2 = 6^2 = 36 \).
- Compute the new remainder:
  \[
  r_2 = 76 - 36 = 40
  \]

#### Step 3: Find \( c^2 \)
- Compute \( c = \lfloor \sqrt{40} \rfloor = 4 \).
- \( c^2 = 4^2 = 16 \).
- Compute the new remainder:
  \[
  r_3 = 40 - 16 = 24
  \]

#### Step 4: Find \( d^2 \)
- Compute \( d = \lfloor \sqrt{24} \rfloor = 2 \).
- \( d^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Verify:
  \[
  r_4 = 24 - 4 = 0
  \]

---

### Final Result
Using Legendre's method, we decompose \( 2012 \) as:
\[
2012 = 44^2 + 6^2 + 4^2 + 2^2
\]

- \( 44^2 = 1936 \),
- \( 6^2 = 36 \),
- \( 4^2 = 16 \),
- \( 2^2 = 4 \).

Adding them up:
\[
2012 = 1936 + 36 + 16 + 4
\]

---

### Summary of Steps
1. Start with the largest square less than \( n \).
2. Subtract that square from \( n \).
3. Repeat for the remainder until you have four squares.

This systematic method ensures all integers can be expressed as the sum of four squares as per Lagrange's theorem.
