### **Triangular Numbers**

A triangular number represents the total number of objects in a triangle with \( n \) rows, where the first row has 1 object, the second row has 2 objects, and so on.

#### **Formula for the \( n \)-th Triangular Number**
The \( n \)-th triangular number, \( T_n \), is given by:
\[
T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]

---

#### **Derivation of the Formula**
The triangular number is the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers:
\[
T_n = 1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n
\]
The sum of the first \( n \) integers is known to be:
\[
T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]

---

#### **Examples**
- \( T_1 = \frac{1(1+1)}{2} = 1 \)
- \( T_2 = \frac{2(2+1)}{2} = 3 \)
- \( T_3 = \frac{3(3+1)}{2} = 6 \)
- \( T_4 = \frac{4(4+1)}{2} = 10 \)

---

### **Square Numbers**

A square number represents the total number of objects that can fill a perfect square with \( n \times n \) dimensions.

#### **Formula for the \( n \)-th Square Number**
The \( n \)-th square number, \( S_n \), is given by:
\[
S_n = n^2
\]

---

#### **Derivation of the Formula**
The square number is simply the product of a number with itself:
\[
S_n = n \times n = n^2
\]

---

#### **Examples**
- \( S_1 = 1^2 = 1 \)
- \( S_2 = 2^2 = 4 \)
- \( S_3 = 3^2 = 9 \)
- \( S_4 = 4^2 = 16 \)

---

### **Summary**
1. **Triangular Numbers**:
   \[
   T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
   \]
2. **Square Numbers**:
   \[
   S_n = n^2
   \]


Letâ€™s derive the formulas for **triangular numbers** and **square numbers** step by step.

---

### **1. Deriving the Formula for Triangular Numbers**

#### Step 1: Understand the concept of triangular numbers
Triangular numbers are the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers:
\[
T_n = 1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + n
\]

#### Step 2: Write the sum in two ways
Write the sum \( T_n = 1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + n \) in reverse order:
\[
T_n = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + \dots + 1
\]

Add the two expressions term by term:
\[
T_n + T_n = (1 + n) + (2 + (n-1)) + (3 + (n-2)) + \dots + (n + 1)
\]

Each pair of terms adds up to \( n + 1 \), and there are \( n \) pairs. So:
\[
2T_n = n(n+1)
\]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( T_n \)
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]

---

#### Examples:
1. \( T_1 = \frac{1(1+1)}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)
2. \( T_2 = \frac{2(2+1)}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)
3. \( T_3 = \frac{3(3+1)}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \)
4. \( T_4 = \frac{4(4+1)}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \)

---

### **2. Deriving the Formula for Square Numbers**

#### Step 1: Understand the concept of square numbers
A square number is the product of a number with itself. For \( n \), it represents the area of a square with side length \( n \):
\[
S_n = n \times n
\]

#### Step 2: Write the formula
The formula for the \( n \)-th square number is straightforward:
\[
S_n = n^2
\]

---

#### Examples:
1. \( S_1 = 1^2 = 1 \)
2. \( S_2 = 2^2 = 4 \)
3. \( S_3 = 3^2 = 9 \)
4. \( S_4 = 4^2 = 16 \)

---

### **Summary of Formulas**

1. **Triangular Numbers**:
   \[
   T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
   \]
   Derived from summing the first \( n \) natural numbers.

2. **Square Numbers**:
   \[
   S_n = n^2
   \]
   Derived from the definition of squares.
