To prove that if \( \gcd(a, b) = 1 \) and \( 1 = ax + by \) for some integers \( x \) and \( y \), then \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \), we will use the following steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Given Information

- \( \gcd(a, b) = 1 \): This means that \( a \) and \( b \) have no common divisors other than 1, or in other words, \( a \) and \( b \) are coprime.
- \( 1 = ax + by \): This means that the greatest common divisor of \( a \) and \( b \) can be written as a linear combination of \( a \) and \( b \), i.e., there exist integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( 1 = ax + by \).

We need to prove that under these conditions, \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \).

### Step 2: Prove the Statement

Let’s assume, for the sake of contradiction, that \( \gcd(x, y) = d > 1 \). This would mean that \( d \) divides both \( x \) and \( y \). Since \( d \) divides both \( x \) and \( y \), we can express \( x \) and \( y \) as:
\[
x = d \cdot x' \quad \text{and} \quad y = d \cdot y'
\]
for some integers \( x' \) and \( y' \).

Now substitute these into the equation \( 1 = ax + by \):
\[
1 = a(d \cdot x') + b(d \cdot y') = d \cdot (a \cdot x' + b \cdot y')
\]
Thus, \( 1 \) is divisible by \( d \), which implies \( d \) divides 1. But the only positive integer that divides 1 is 1 itself. Therefore, \( d = 1 \).

Thus, we have shown that \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \).

### Conclusion

If \( \gcd(a, b) = 1 \) and \( 1 = ax + by \), then \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \).

### Step 3: Verification in the Cases Above

We can verify this result by checking the cases above for which we computed the GCD using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.

Let’s start with case (i), where we found \( \gcd(2009, 9002) = 7 \), and expressed it as a linear combination of \( 2009 \) and \( 9002 \).

#### Case (i): \( a = 2009, b = 9002 \)

From the calculations in part (i), we found the equation:
\[
7 = 52 \times 9002 - 233 \times 2009
\]
Thus, \( x = 52 \) and \( y = -233 \).

Now, let’s compute \( \gcd(52, -233) \):
\[
\gcd(52, -233) = \gcd(52, 233) = 1
\]
This verifies the statement that \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \).

#### Case (ii): \( a = 13579, b = 2468 \)

From the previous calculation, we found that \( \gcd(13579, 2468) = 1 \), and we expressed it as:
\[
1 = 123 \times 2468 - 124 \times 1239
\]
Thus, \( x = 123 \) and \( y = -124 \).

Now, let’s compute \( \gcd(123, -124) \):
\[
\gcd(123, -124) = \gcd(123, 124) = 1
\]
This verifies the statement that \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \).

---

### Conclusion of Verification

In both cases above, we verified that the GCD of \( x \) and \( y \) is 1, as expected from the proof.

Hence, in both of the provided cases, \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \), confirming that the proof holds.
