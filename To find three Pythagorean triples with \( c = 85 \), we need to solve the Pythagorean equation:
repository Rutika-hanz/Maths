To find three Pythagorean triples with \( c = 85 \), we need to solve the Pythagorean equation:

\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\]

### Step 1: Use the Pythagorean Triple Formula
A primitive Pythagorean triple can be generated using:
\[
a = m^2 - n^2, \quad b = 2mn, \quad c = m^2 + n^2
\]
where:
- \( m > n > 0 \),
- \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime,
- \( m - n \) is odd.

### Step 2: Solve for \( c = 85 \)
Here, \( c = m^2 + n^2 = 85 \). We solve for integer values of \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m^2 + n^2 = 85 \).

1. Start with \( m = 9 \) and \( n = 2 \) because \( 9^2 + 2^2 = 81 + 4 = 85 \).
    - \( a = m^2 - n^2 = 81 - 4 = 77 \),
    - \( b = 2mn = 2 \cdot 9 \cdot 2 = 36 \).
    - Triple: \( (a, b, c) = (77, 36, 85) \).

2. \( m = 7 \) and \( n = 6 \) satisfy \( m^2 + n^ c
