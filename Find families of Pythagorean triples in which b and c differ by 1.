To find families of **Pythagorean triples** where \( b \) and \( c \) differ by 1 (\( c - b = 1 \)), let's analyze the problem systematically.

---

### General Form of Pythagorean Triples
A Pythagorean triple satisfies:
\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\]
where \( a, b, c \) are integers.

Using the standard parametric form for generating Pythagorean triples:
\[
a = m^2 - n^2, \quad b = 2mn, \quad c = m^2 + n^2
\]
where \( m > n > 0 \), \( m, n \) are coprime, and \( m - n \) is odd.

---

### Condition: \( c - b = 1 \)
We substitute \( b = 2mn \) and \( c = m^2 + n^2 \) into the condition:
\[
c - b = 1
\]
\[
m^2 + n^2 - 2mn = 1
\]
Rearranging:
\[
m^2 - 2mn + n^2 = 1
\]
\[
(m - n)^2 = 1
\]

---

### Solving the Equation
\[
(m - n)^2 = 1
\]
This implies:
\[
m - n = \pm 1
\]

#### Case 1: \( m - n = 1 \)
If \( m - n = 1 \), then \( m = n + 1 \). Substituting this into the formulas for \( a, b, c \):
\[
a = (n+1)^2 - n^2 = 2n + 1
\]
\[
b = 2(n+1)n = 2n^2 + 2n
\]
\[
c = (n+1)^2 + n^2 = 2n^2 + 2n + 1
\]

Thus, the triple is:
\[
(a, b, c) = (2n+1, 2n^2 + 2n, 2n^2 + 2n + 1)
\]

#### Case 2: \( m - n = -1 \)
If \( m - n = -1 \), this is not valid because \( m > n > 0 \).

### Family of Triples
The family of Pythagorean triples where \( c - b = 1 \) is given by:
\[
a = 2n + 1, \quad b = 2n^2 + 2n, \quad c = 2n^2 + 2n + 1
\]

---

### Examples
Letâ€™s compute some examples by substituting values for \( n \):

1. **For \( n = 1 \):**
   \[
   a = 2(1) + 1 = 3, \quad b = 2(1^2) + 2(1) = 4, \quad c = 2(1^2) + 2(1) + 1 = 5
   \]
   Triple: \( (3, 4, 5) \)

2. **For \( n = 2 \):**
   \[
   a = 2(2) + 1 = 5, \quad b = 2(2^2) + 2(2) = 12, \quad c = 2(2^2) + 2(2) + 1 = 13
   \]
   Triple: \( (5, 12, 13) \)

3. **For \( n = 3 \):**
   \[
   a = 2(3) + 1 = 7, \quad b = 2(3^2) + 2(3) = 24, \quad c = 2(3^2) + 2(3) + 1 = 25
   \]
   Triple: \( (7, 24, 25) \)

---

### Conclusion
The family of Pythagorean triples where \( b \) and \( c \) differ by 1 is:
\[
(a, b, c) = (2n+1, 2n^2 + 2n, 2n^2 + 2n + 1)
\]
where \( n \) is a positive integer.
